# Market_Segmentation
This repository contains a Python script for performing market segmentation analysis. The analysis involves using a dataset with various columns related to customer characteristics, such as Recreational, Health, Career, Financial, Safety, and Social, and applying common market segmentation techniques to explore and group customers based on these features.

Project Overview
This project focuses on applying market segmentation techniques to customer data. The aim is to cluster customers into distinct segments using features such as health, career, financial status, etc., and then use those segments for targeted marketing strategies. The process includes:

Data exploration and cleaning
Applying clustering algorithms
Evaluating and profiling segments
Data Description
The dataset used for this project includes the following columns:

Recreational: Customer’s interest in recreational activities.
Health: Customer’s health status.
Career: Customer’s professional background or aspirations.
Financial: Customer’s financial standing.
Safety: Concerns related to safety or security.
Social: Social behavior or engagement levels.
Each row represents a customer, and the values in these columns describe customer behaviors, preferences, and demographic factors.

Setup Instructions
Clone the repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/<username>/<repository>.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd <repository>
Install the required libraries:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Once the necessary libraries are installed, you can run the Python script to perform market segmentation.

bash
Copy code
python market_segmentation.py
This will load the dataset, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), apply a clustering algorithm, and output the results of customer segmentation.

Methodology
The segmentation process is carried out using the following steps:

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing the data.
Exploratory Data Analysis: Understanding the data distribution and identifying any patterns.
Clustering Algorithm: Applying K-means clustering (or any other clustering algorithm) to segment customers.
Profiling Segments: Analyzing the features of each segment to define and describe customer groups.
Results
The resulting segments will be profiled based on their unique characteristics across the six columns. These segments can help in formulating marketing strategies or targeted outreach.
